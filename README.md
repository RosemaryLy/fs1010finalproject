# FS1010FinalProject

In this project, I am connecting a node.js/Express backend with a React Frontend. 
The goal of this project is to be able to send Form Data from React and have it update a JSON file. 

I also installed concurrently as a npm package so that the server and client can be run together within one terminal. 

All you need to do is $npm run dev to start both front and back end.
